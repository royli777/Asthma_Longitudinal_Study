# Asthma_Longitudinal_Study

This is motivated by a longitudinal study focusing on C-SCD patients. 

Mondal, Pritish (2023), “Impact of BMI on IOS measures”, Mendeley Data, V1, doi: 10.17632/rwcvfz9np9.1. https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rwcvfz9np9/1

We explored some scientific questions based on this study.

The abstract of our study:
Backgrounds: 
Obesity is a significant risk factor for asthma, with higher body mass index (BMI) linked to impaired respiratory function. However, the confounding factor
of comorbidities, such as Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), is often overlooked. 

Methods:
Using Impulse Oscillometry data from 74 African American children (39 with SCD), we applied Generalized Linear Mixed Models to explore the relationship of BMI and
airway resistance and reactance of asthma patients, adjusting for age, gender,
pharmacotherapy, and SCD, while incorporating BMI-gender interactions. 

Results:
Higher BMI was associated with reduced total airway resistance (p = 0.0096), central
airway resistance (p = 0.0378), and resonant frequency (p < 0.0001). A significant
BMI-gender interaction for resonant frequency (p = 0.0321) indicated gender-specific
effects.

Conclusions: 
BMI negatively impacts airway resistance and reactance in Asthma, with gender-specific differences. Tailored interventions are crucial for
improving respiratory health.
